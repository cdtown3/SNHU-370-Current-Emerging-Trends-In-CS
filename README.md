# SNHU-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-In-CS

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
In this project, I was given starter code for a treasure hunt game, where the player and pirate face off to find the treasure before each other. The given code contains the code to generate the maze and class to store experiences used by the deep Q-learning algorithm. My assignment was to implement this deep Q-learning algorithm in Python, which controls the pirate's actions as it moves throughout the maze, and chooses these actions based on the current state, exploitation variable, and exploration variable. In this project, the pirate would explore a new action every 10 actions taken. If it stepped on an empty tile it was penalized slightly. If it stepped on an occupied tile, it was penalized to the max extent. If it found the treasure, it was rewarded to the max extent. This program ran through epochs until it had a 100% win rate, which took about 10 minutes.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
In this course we went over emerging trends like the latest AI algorithms and the new EU's GDPR implementation. I now have a more rounded understanding on developing AI using methods such as the Actor-Critic method and the Monte Carlo method for example. I also understand the importance of privacy and ethical concerns surrounding how a company might gather, store, and use data from users.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
As computer scientists, we solve everyday issues in the most efficient manner possible. AI has been thought about and used for many years now, and I believe we're now realizing how much it can do for us. We aren't even close to unlocking its full potential for solving issues, but we are dipping our toe in the water. As a computer scientist, I want to contribute to this research and implement AI in areas I feel could benefit humanity. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, the user is always at the forefront. There are necessary questions we must ask ourselves when developing such as: 
What data to I need? 
Why do I need this data?
Can I anonymize this data?
How can I safely secure this data?
Does the user know that I'm gathering and using their data? If not, shouldn't they?
As I think about these questions I can get to a safe, secure, and ethical solution to the various issues I'm trying to solve with an application.
